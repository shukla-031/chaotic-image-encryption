# Image Encryption Tool with Chaotic Maps

A Python-based GUI application for image encryption and decryption using chaotic maps (Arnold's Cat Map, Logistic Map, and Cosine Map).

## Features

- **Encryption**: Secure image encryption using multiple chaotic maps
- **Decryption**: Lossless image decryption with correct parameters
- **GUI**: User-friendly Tkinter interface
- **Entropy Analysis**: Calculate and compare image entropy
- **Multiple Formats**: Support for TIFF, PNG, JPG, BMP

## Algorithms Used

1. **Arnold's Cat Map**: Image scrambling
2. **Logistic Map**: Chaotic sequence generation
3. **Cosine Map**: Additional chaotic sequence generation

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone (https://github.com/shukla-031/chaotic-image-encryption/commits?author=shukla-031)
cd image-encryption-tool
